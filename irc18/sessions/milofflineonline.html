	    <h5>&nbsp;</h5>
	    <h4>Context of the Session</h4>
	    <p>The choice of the theme 'Offline' for the conference is both relevant and timely, particularly for the Indian society, that is in transition towards information-intensive society. In addition to the conference mode, I think the workshop mode is another very effective way of learning. In the digital age, where everyday information is increasingly being made available - sometimes only - online, being offline is a major challenge for an increasing population of users in the country, and especially for certain user groups, who are not tech-savvy or are not very familiar with English language or are otherwise in a disadvantageous position regarding online systems. In such an environment, developing media and information literacy (MIL) skills is seen a part of the solution in transition towards information-intensive society.</p>
	    <h4>Session Plan</h4>
	    <p>This proposed session would be an interactive one, where conference delegates would be working in different groups, and each group would be addressing a
different facet of the session theme. The time required for such a session would be between 75 to 90 minutes. In 2016, when we (myself, along with other resource persons from different countries), organized a workshop on MIL at the quadrennial World Forum for Media Development held at Jakarta (Indonesia) - where participants were from around the globe and from diverse sectors - its outcome was amazing in terms of issues and concerns that arose from its discussions. And I hope that
the proposed workshop session on 'Media and information literacy in offline and online environments" during the IRC2018 Conference would also yield similar results.</p>
        <p>In addition, the proposed workshop session would also give the participants an international perspective on Media and  Information Literacy from UNESCO's viewpoint as well as that of GAPMIL. For more information on GAPMIL, kindly access the following link on UNESCO website: <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/media-development/media-literacy/global-alliance-for-partnerships-on-media-and-information-literacy/">http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/media-development/media-literacy/global-alliance-for-partnerships-on-media-and-information-literacy/</a>.</p>
