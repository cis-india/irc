	    <h4>Context of the Session</h4>
	    <p>How might Internet temporalities and spaces relate to what Alain Badiou calls the “event of politics” and also to what Badiou terms the “worldless space of global capitalism.” (Badiou, 2001, Zizek, 2011) This exploratory panel will examine how digital divides that are structured by classism; casteism and urbanization produce Offline feminism and queer politics.  We will focus on key movements/moments and address a few broad philosophical questions.  The discussion focuses on the possibilities and problematics of “offline” organizing in the context of farmer suicide and indebtedness, debates regarding the role technology plays in ending gender based violence, and the construction of spaces of revelry, care, and affect created by and for feminists.</p>
        <p><em>What might offline feminism look like in India today?</em></p>
        <p>This question is framed in the context of farmer indebtedness and suicide, and threats to the dignity and right to life of farmers, many of whom are women.  Panelists will draw on United Nations research and participatory research with female farmers that largely took place Offline.  We will ask how digital technologies can be useful tools in organizing farmers’ rights movements and the challenges of using technology in rural India.</p>
        <p>Participants will also discuss feminist activism and creative production in occupied Kashmir, where technology has been consistently censored by the Indian state.</p>
        <p><em>Are Offline and Online world’s really separate from each other?  What are implications for ostensibly pure #Offline spaces for feminists?</em></p>
        <p>The Panel also touches on recent debates in the feminist/queer movement in India and globally, regarding sexual harassment and gender based violence.  Panelists will address how and why a polarizing rhetoric has emerged, often attempting to construct succinct binaries of Offline versus Online feminism.  We will question how and why “Internet feminism” is constructed as antithetical to actions taken against gender based harassment and violence where technology is not central?</p>
        <p>This discussion is part of a broader theme that the panel will address, which questions whether there is really an ostensibly “pure” Offline world or a wholly Online realm that exist separately from each other.  Imagining a pastoral pre-technological moment particularly in the Indian subcontinent may revisit Orientalist discourse.  Similarly, uses of the Internet in India and globally occur in context and are imbricated into the workings of broader societal norms and histories of power.</p>
        <p>Drawing on personal experiences, panelists will ask if and when the Internet functions as an effective tool against gender based violence. We will also share Offline strategies for dealing with traumatic encounters with misogyny.</p>
        <p>Participants will address the importance of and challenges of cultivating offline feminist/queer spaces of meeting, art production, music and revelry.</p>
        <p><em>How does online and offline movement building structure emotional bonds?</em></p>
        <p>Is #feminism a political party of one, comprised of competing marginalities, banging keys and staring into screens? Are spaces of enjoyment and care important for the feminist movement IRL?</p>
        <p>When we meet in the streets, and enter each other’s lives in real time, do we experience something that might be stronger than an Internet connection?</p>

	    <h4>Paper Abstracts</h4>
        <p><strong>Rashmi Munikempanna</strong></p>
        <p>In 2016 the women’s wing of the Haveri district committee of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (Karnataka State Farmers’ Association) launched a campaign to highlight the violence they were facing at the hands of micro finance institutions because of indebtedness. Karnataka had faced unprecedented drought in the year 2016 leaving farmers heavily in debt. Women, as part of self-help groups, took on loans for agriculture leaving them unable to repay opening them up to harassment. Initial research on this was presented as part of structural contexts that threaten food security, for women, at the UN. The modes/methods of organizing used in this campaign was predominantly offline. The questions that interest me seeks to look at what offline feminism might look like in rural India today? And is it completely offline? Can and do communication platforms such as WhatsApp function as organizing tools? As someone who performs the role of a search engine for various activists/campaigns I do believe that digital access could enable in ways that strengthen grassroots organizing.</p>
        <p><strong>Mamatha Karollil - <em>'The List': Polarizing but Not Necessarily So</em></strong></p>
        <p>The publishing of ‘the list’ of alleged sexual harassers in Indian academia online has provoked intense debate on modes of feminist resistance to / organizing against patriarchy- via legal routes, institutional procedures and due process pitted AGAINST what has been characterized as reactive, atavistic, forms of unthought through ‘mob justice’(as particularly afforded by the internet). Another framing of the debate - and this informs the larger #metoo online campaign as well- has been the framing of it through notions of the sensational, the trendy, a particularly egregious effect /form of the much maligned identity politics (again, as afforded by the internet) versus more substantive, long-term and outcome-oriented forms of ‘real’ feminist organizing. I would like to examine these against longstanding divergences and debates within feminist politics, looking for convergences, appealing for a both-and logic as against an either-or one.</p>
	    <h4>Session Plan</h4>
	    <p>The session is envisioned as a panel discussion that will include feminist and queer artists, activists and thinkers in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
        <p>The objectives of this session are to have a meaningful dialogue regarding the role that offline and online movement building, protest and dialogue play in feminist and queer movements in India and globally. The objective of this session also lies in touching on topical issues in Indian feminist and queer politics from a perspective that pays close and critical attention to technology, its use, overuse and implications. I hope that the discussion generates an interesting dialogue. If possible, the presentations from this session could be recorded and help to form an archive regarding contemporary debates in feminist/queer politics in India. If possible, papers from this panel could also be published online.</p>
