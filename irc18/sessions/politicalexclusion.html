	    <h4>Context of the Session</h4>
	    <p>Social media platforms have been vaunted for their role in overthrowing authoritarian governments and giving citizens the tools to organise and fight for their rights. However, in the last few years, a disturbing trend has started to unravel, in which these same tools are being used to undermine the democratic process. Looming large is Russian interference in the 2016 US elections and Brexit.</p>
        <p>In India, the BJP IT Cell, since the months leading up to the 2014 elections has been using social media machinery to influence voters by spreading misinformation about opponents, directly attacking critics on Twitter and Facebook with slander and serious threats and crucially, influencing the political discourse of the region. Political propaganda has invaded family WhatsApp groups and users of social media, whether in rural or urban India, are bound to feel the impact. Many political parties in the country have dedicated social media managers to propagate their agendas on social media and invest a large amount of time and money on this. Social media platforms have become sites where political discourse is shaped, with serious - often violent - consequences for political engagement in the offline. This is alarming since penetration of social media use in the country stands at 12 per cent.* Thereby effectively excluding most of the population from political discourse which affects them.</p>
        <p>We aim to investigate the impact of this political exclusion.</p>
        <p>We will also attempt to provide preliminary theoretical insights into the new economy of online political interference - operating through investments, deliberate production of misinformation and attempts to manufacture influence through political marketing, and labour - which may not be illegal, but still have a negative impact on the quality of democratic life. We will engage with the offline conditions under which this new economy of online political propaganda and mediated democracy is emerging, and the implications it has for offline political life. In the context of the growing online misinformation ecosystem, does offline political engagement offer greater potential for enhancing the quality of political discourse?</p>
	    <h4>Session Plan</h4>
	    <p>This is how we plan to conduct the session:</p>
        <ul><li>Start by talking about the social media ecosystem - the tech behind it, the monetary interests of platform owners, users and user behaviour, parties exploiting this for their purpose whether it be businesses, political parties or individuals</li>
        <li>Present findings - Most research will be done based on secondary material. We plan to add interviews with offline citizens to gauge the impact of the exclusion and investigate how they engage with the political.</li></ul>
