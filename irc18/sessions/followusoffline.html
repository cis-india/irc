	    <h4>Context of the Session</h4>
	    <p>With the outcrop of small community archives online that have been enabled by increased, if unequal, digital access the lives of both big and small data have been the subject of much debate lately. This presentation seeks to investigate the archival processes that precede and succeed the archival moment in the offline space.</p>
        <p>The session looks at both archival architectures and how they connect to the offline as well as the process of data creation, interpretation and analysis as an essentially offline activity especially in the digital humanities. It reflects on data creation for an archive and the interpretative and organisational logics that determines inclusion. It also comments on institutional structures and procedures as essential drivers of the life of a digital archive with resources and institutional politics playing an important role in the nature, use and access of the archive.</p>
        <p>Once the archive comes into being various elements in the architecture of the archive itself enable a selective engagement with the offline propelled by the archive’s politics. This can manifest in metadata derivation, access, dissemination, assigned user roles and hierarchies and the archive’s approach to validation and annotation.</p>
        <p>Access to the archive then invites questions of use and performance. Who chooses to see what in what context? How does the access that the archive enable direct this performance? Communally annotated archives reflect social processes that may be independent of the original archival impulse and generate new data and open new archival pathways.</p>
        <p>We will open up a discussion on an architecture of an offline archive and will include Mobility and Mirroring, Metadata derivation, Multipoint curation, Decentralized Annotations, Distribution versus privacy, Decentralized authentication, Software independence, Inclusive of low-literates, Community ownership and intrusion detection, Trust, Validation, ...</p>
        <p>We intend to document these discussions and take this forward by initiating a reference implementation of such an archive.</p>
	    <h4>Session Plan</h4>
	    <p>Our aim is to first bring to the table the context of work being done by introducing practices of archivists and tabulate the needs with focus on the offline in their workflow. Added along will be some examples of our work regarding the Intangible Cultural heritage. We then present the software heritage work so as to contemplate a digital dark age whereby we plan to converge on best practices for keeping an archive available in the future. We then open the discussion to make a wishlist from all participants and negotiate the way these can be considered in the architecture of the offline archive.</p>
        <p>Session will be as follows.</p>
        <ul><li>Stories, games and archives work samples,</li>
        <li>Festivals and rituals - Living archives of the memories,</li>
        <li>Proposal of an architecture of an offline archive, and</li>
        <li>Opening the space for a wishlist discussion.</li></ul>
