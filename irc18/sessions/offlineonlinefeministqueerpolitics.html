	    <h4>Context of the Session</h4>
	    <p>How might Internet temporalities and spaces relate to what Alain Badiou calls the “event of politics” and also to what Badiou terms the “worldless space of global capitalism.” (Badiou, 2001, Zizek, 2011) This exploratory panel will discuss the politics of online/offline feminist and queer politics. We will focus on the Internet as a feminist tool that challenges institutionalized sexism, while also addressing the need for offline activism.</p>
        <p>The panel will also address the politics of Internet surveillance and openness in the context of India, where Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code criminalizes “unnatural” sexual acts, threatening the dignity, desires and freedom of queer people.</p>
        <p>This session will focus on discussing key debates and movements in feminist/queer movements and their relationship to digital realms. These sites of engagement include but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul><li>Debates regarding sexual harassment complaints on University campuses, Occupations of public space as feminist/queer strategies of protest,</li>
        <li>The discourse of `smart cities’ and the implications for marginalized people,</li>
        <li>The caste, class, regional and gendered nature of technological access and use in India,</li>
        <li>The use of the Internet as a realm of artistic imagining for feminist and queer politics</li></ul>
        <p>What does “offline” mean in feminist/queer movements? Does the #Metoo of online feminism extend solidarity to the majority of women in India who do not have access to the Internet? Does the Internet create a vernacular of feminist and queer terminologies that are reflective of global capitalist hegemony?</p>
        <p>The discussion will also ask how online and offline movement building structure emotional bonds. When we meet in the streets, and enter each other’s lives in real time, do we experience something that might be stronger than an Internet connection?</p>

	    <h4>Session Plan</h4>
	    <p>The session is envisioned as a panel discussion that will include feminist and queer artists, activists and thinkers in the Indian subcontinent. As the moderator/organizer of the session I plan to invite 4 speakers who will address the themes of the panel. If it is necessary I can also give a presentation 
depending on which speakers are available and can confirm their participation:</p>
        <p><em>Timeline:</em></p>
        <p>I will invite the speakers and have attendance confirmed by the middle of January. I would like to invite:</p>
        <ul><li>Someone from <a href="http://www.fat-net.org">FAT (Feminist Approaches to Technology)</a></li>
        <li>Someone from the <a href="https://internetdemocracy.in/people/">Internet Democracy Project</a></li>
        <li>I hope to find someone who could comment on the <a href="https://www.dailyo.in/politics/sexual-harassment-raya-sarkar-kafila-indian-feminism/story/1/20291.html">debates regarding sexual harassment and cyber feminism in India</a></li>
        <li>Finally, I would like to invite a queer activist, thinker to discuss the politics of online media, representation, and surveillance in contemporary India. I have approached members of the Queer Collective at Ambedkar University Delhi and am waiting for confirmation. I could also approach the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ComeOutLoudOfficial/">Come Out Loud</a> project to find an appropriate and available speaker</li></ul>
        <p>After confirming the participation of the speakers, brief blurbs or abstracts of the presentations will be circulated among conference organizers and online.</p>
        <p>The objectives of this session are to have a meaningful dialogue regarding the role that offline and online movement building, protest and dialogue play in feminist and queer movements in India and globally. The objective of this session also lies in touching on topical issues in Indian feminist and queer politics 
from a perspective that pays close and critical attention to technology, its use, overuse and implications. I hope that the discussion generates an interesting dialogue. If possible, the presentations from this session could be recorded and help to form an archive regarding contemporary debates in feminist/queer politics in India. If possible, papers from this panel could also be published online.</p>
	    <h4>Session Team</h4>
	    <p><strong>Tara Atluri</strong> has a Ph.D in Sociology. She is the author of two books. The first text discusses sexual politics in the Indian subcontinent. This book draws on interviews regarding contemporary feminist and queer movements in India following the 2012 gang rape and murder of Jyoti Singh in Delhi and the 2013 Supreme Court decision to uphold Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, a colonial sodomy law. This book is titled: <em>Azadi: Sexual Politics and Postcolonial Worlds</em> (Toronto: Demeter Press, 2016). The second book discusses feminist, transgender and queer political art and artists who challenge the aesthetics of white supremacy, Euro centrism. This book is titled: <em>Uncommitted Crimes: The Defiance of the Artistic Imagi/nation</em> (Toronto: Inanna Publications, December 
2017).</p>
