	    <h4>Description of the Session</h4>
	    <p>The digital divide is a huge concern in India. This digital divide has many facets including the absence of socially-culturally relevant content, non-availability of enabling infrastructure, high cost of access and digital illiteracy but one of the most important divide emerges from the power and dominance of the English language on internet, which limits the emancipatory possibilities of new media. This has serious consequences for democratic participation and mobilisation as the emerging digital public sphere is not equally accessible and participative for millions of citizens in India.</p>
	    <p>While it was expected that the emerging digital public sphere or “networked public” will be more democratic, accessible, participative and empowering (Benkler, 2006; Shirky, 2008; Papacharissi, 2010; Boyd, 2010), it has turned out to be less equitable and participative, a narrow and hierarchical public sphere which is against the idea of a vibrant, open, free and participative public sphere as argued by the German scholar Jurgen Habermas and which is crucial to free debate-discussion and public action in democracy.</p>
	    <p>Clearly mere infrastructure development is not the solution to bridge the digital divide. It requires open, free, democratic and accessible internet in all aspect including more socially-culturally and representative content in Indian languages and dialects and also content created by women, dalits, adivasis, minorities and marginalised groups of hierarchical Indian society.</p>
	    <p>It is heartening to note that slowly but surely powerful subaltern voices in Indic languages have started emerging on the internet and its many platforms. These voices are playing a crucial role in making the digital public sphere more democratic, participative and argumentative. But the Indic digital public sphere is also polluted and threatened by the majoritarian trolls who are spreading communal and vicious propaganda messages, rumours and lies, abusing the marginal voices, posing a huge challenge.</p>
	    <p>This panel will delve into the various aspects related to the internet and Indic languages, through a theoretical prism as well as take into account the ground reality. It will also examine and analyse the Indic content created by marginalised groups, which is available on new media especially on social media. The panel will discuss its implications for Indian democracy. Other aspects would include topics raised by scholars such as Burgess (2007) which include ‘vernacular creativity’, remediated in the new media context, the socio-technological shaping of participation in digital culture and the implications for cultural citizenship.</p>	    
	    <h4>Session Plan</h4>
	    <p>Each panelist will speak on any one the above-mentioned themes for ten minutes, raising issues and challenges specific to that area. This will be followed by a discussion on appreciating and theorising the functioning of and meaning-making by digital objects in Indic languages. With the proposed panel having scholars whose first languages include Hindi, Assamese and Bangla, the discussions centring around vernaculars should be having a first-hand feel of the digital divide in the context of Indic languages.</p>
	    <p>It is proposed that to involve Indic language speakers, we may use updates on Twitter in at least Hindi, Assamese and Bangla, with appropriate hashtags in the respective languages.</p>	    
	    <h4>Documentation Plan</h4>
	    <p>Each panelist will write a 3000-word research paper on the themes identified for the panel discussion. All the papers will also be converted into infographics and explanatory multi-media presentations for further dissemination. It would be useful to have translations of all the papers into regional languages.</p>
