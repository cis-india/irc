	    <h4>Description of the Session</h4>
	    <p>In 2014, The Government of India unveiled DotBharat country code Top Level Domain (ccTLD), which is available in Devanagiri script and covers eight languages Hindi, Dogri, Maithili, Bodo, Marathi, Konkani, Nepali and Sindhi. The other Indian languages including Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Odiya are also in the process of being included. Domain names are to some extent windows to the Internet and have socio economic impacts for individuals and organizations alike. The Chinese and Japanese language TLDs were opened up in 2007.</p>
	    <p>Though the number of TLDs are more than 1,300, apart from .com that contributes to about 50 percent of web sites, the adoption of non-English domain names is very poor. This session intends to cover the following:</p>
	    <ol><li>What is the adoption rate/ level of non-English TLDs, especially those that were launched much ahead of DotBharat such as Japanese and Chinese TLDs?</li>
	    <li>Can the hypothesis that Indic language domain names will improve promotion of more Indic language web sites and their adoption be supported?</li>
	    <li>Who can be the potential users of these domain names?</li></ol>
	    <h4>Session Plan</h4>
	    <p>Prof. Amit Prakash will moderate the session. Dr. V. Sridhar will introduce the context of the panel and provide some empirical evidence of the adoption
of non-English domains. The speakers will be Dr. Srinivasan Ramani, K.A. Dayanand, and Vivek Pani. This will be followed by Q&A from the audience.</p>
	    <h4>Documentation Plan</h4>
	    <p>There will be a few articles written on the techno-socio-economics of domain names that will be written in business newspapers or magazines by the chairs of the session prior to the conference to motivate the theme. Post the conference, there will be a short essay of about 2,000 words prepared and published by the chairs on the outcome of the panel.</p>
	    <p>Target publication outlets:</p>
	    <ol><li>Pre-conference article: Economic Times/ Hindu Business Line</li>
	    <li>Post-conference essay: IIMB Management Review/Vikalpa/ Communications of the ACM blog</li></ol>
