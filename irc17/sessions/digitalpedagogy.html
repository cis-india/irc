	    <p><em>Last updated on Oct 31, 2016.</em></p>
	    <h5>&nbsp;</h5>
	    <h4>Description of the Session</h4>
	    <p>With the increasing visibility of digital humanities research and practice in Indian higher education, a conversation about pedagogical practice in the field might be beneficial and instructive, both for those who have already launched digital humanist modes of scholarship at their institutions, and for those who might be considering the possibility of doing so. This session will address all three themes of the conference through the following:</p>
	    <ul><li>DH as a discipline developed out of intellectual and infrastructural circumstances of the developed world (and the English-speaking world) and as a consequence it is absolutely necessary to conceive of alternative frameworks and to occupy a position of decolonization as the discipline becomes further embedded in the Indian academic landscape. This session will draw on the range of experiences of participants to create an inclusive digital humanities syllabus that takes into account specific local, historical and cultural contexts as well as the different strands of digital humanities scholarship as currently practiced in India. Such a practice would also contribute positively to efforts internationally to create a more intersectional syllabus for use for students everywhere.</li>
	    <li>Digital humanities practice and research plays a profoundly significant role in preserving cultural heritage and material, and in a country where these efforts are relatively minimal and limited, it is crucially important that students of the digital humanities are taught how to work with Indic language and cultural material, in order to both conserve such material, but also to facilitate its incorporation in a humanities corpus that takes its regional and linguistic context of the South Asian subcontinent into consideration. Participants in the session would be encouraged to share best practices with regards to such material, tools that they have used or created to facilitate such research, and how such research can be used for engagement in the classroom, and facilitate resource-building.</li></ul>	    
	    <h4>Session Plan</h4>
	    <p>An introduction by the session leaders will then lead into a facilitated discussion â€“ as the purpose of this workshop is to document and learn more about pedagogical practices, sources, activities and disciplinary contexts of digital humanities teaching in India, participants will be encouraged to share a brief document outlining the courses they teach before the session, to allow for more lively discussion.</p>	    
	    <h4>Documentation Plan</h4>
	    <p>Documentation will be done using collaborative note taking software, and will be used to create a resource for future use to be hosted on the DHAI website.</p>
