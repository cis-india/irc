	    <h3>06. #SelfiesFromTheField</h3>

	    <h5>&nbsp;</h5>
	    <h4>Description of the Session</h4>
	    <p>Borrowing from the third provocation at IRC16, we propose a session on <em>research methods to study, document and analyse</em> work on Internet mediated interactions (IMI).</p>
	    <p>We define Internet Mediated Interactions (IMI) as any interaction enabled by the Internet. Such interactions can take place across diverse platforms or devices such as mobile phones, tablets, or computers. For example, booking a cab through Ola/ Uber is an IMI; virtual games are IMIs; collaborative document editing is an IMI, etc. With the definition of an ethnographic field site evolving over the past few years to include the Internet and virtual worlds, ethnographic research in IMI would involve studies of the people designing and interacting over such platforms.</p>
	    <p>We seek participation from early-career researchers and students currently pursuing research, or with experience only in studying IMI. The objective of the session is to share experiences of grappling with challenges which emerge in <em>doing</em> IMI centred research. Often, early-career researchers/students are simultaneously learning the domains they are researching, methods, and the <em>doing</em> of methods. Being early-career researchers ourselves, reflexive conversations with peers will enable sharing of ways to tackle these challenges, which are often commonly faced. Through the discussions in the session, we hope to facilitate conversations which steer away from the conventional understandings of <em>doing</em> methods.</p>	    
	    <p>The participants will come from academic and non-academic backgrounds, who have looked at IMIs in Indian contexts. This session will explore the following two sub-themes:</p>
	    <ol><li>Access to participants: Doing a study of IMIs poses challenges such as identifying interactions as IMI; or gaining entry into specific Internet-mediated spaces (which may or may not be openly accessible).</li>
	    <li><em>Doing</em> methods: Fieldwork raises questions of what constitutes <em>doing</em> methods. While conversations about methods often end prior to physically conducting fieldwork, <em>doing</em> methods can cause tension with text-book constructs of methods.</li></ol>
	    <h4>Session Plan</h4>
	    <p>Our session focuses on research methods to study and document work on Internet Mediated Interactions (IMI). We define IMI as any interaction enabled
by the Internet. The session provides a platform to share experiences and challenges faced in doing research of IMI. The speakers in the session are early-career researchers and students pursuing research of IMI.</p>
        <p>The session will engage with ideas and practices informing research design, such as choice and selection of field sites; accessing these sites and
participants, given the nature of these interactions, especially since the boundaries of the online and the offline are commonly blurred; transforming
the way tools/methods of research get applied/used; along with raising pertinent ethical questions around informed consent, privacy, and the role of the researcher. While the session focusses on IMI, we hope that the learnings from this sessions would be of use and relevant across different methodological approaches and research domains.</p>
        <p>The session will comprise of five presentations of ten minutes each, followed by a panel discussion:</p>
        <ul><li>Abhilash Maradwar, Ishan Sharma, Shubham Mallade, and Dr. Sachit Rao - <em>Evaluating Twitter as a Feedback Mechanism for Addressing Customer
Grievances</em></li>
        <li>Dr. Anuradha Rao - Methodological Challenges and Choices in the Study of Internet Mediated Interactions (IMI): Ethnographic Experiences from
Bangalore</li>
        <li>Priyanka Ivatury - Conducting ethnographic research on online healthcare platforms</li>
        <li>Sreelakshmi R - Mobile Apps and Urban Commuting</li>
        <li>Sugandha Sehgal - Aesthetics of the non-normative female body in contemporary digital visual culture: Gender and Instagram</li></ul>
        <p>The session is organised and will be moderated by Kavitha Narayanan, Onkar Hoysala, and Oindrila Matilal.</p>
	    <h4>Documentation Plan</h4>
	    <p>The talks and discussions of this session will be synthesised for the working paper (for IRC17). In the working paper, we hope to develop working definitions for key ideas identified during the session (an idea inspired from Boellstorff et al., 2012). This working paper will act as a starting point for future publications. Also, the dissemination of discussions to a wider non-academic audience will be informed by suggestions from the participants.</p>
