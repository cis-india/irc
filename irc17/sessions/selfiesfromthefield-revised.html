	    <h3>06. #SelfiesFromTheField</h3>

	    <h4>Description of the Session</h4>
	    <p>Borrowing from the third provocation at IRC16, we propose a session on <em>research methods to study, document and analyse</em> work on Internet mediated interactions (IMI).</p>
	    <p>We define Internet Mediated Interactions (IMI) as any interaction enabled by the Internet. Such interactions can take place across diverse platforms or devices such as mobile phones, tablets, or computers. For example, booking a cab through Ola/ Uber is an IMI; virtual games are IMIs; collaborative document editing is an IMI, etc. With the definition of an ethnographic field site evolving over the past few years to include the Internet and virtual worlds, ethnographic research in IMI would involve studies of the people designing and interacting over such platforms.</p>
	    <p>We seek participation from early-career researchers and students currently pursuing research, or with experience only in studying IMI. The objective of the session is to share experiences of grappling with challenges which emerge in <em>doing</em> IMI centred research. Often, early-career researchers/students are simultaneously learning the domains they are researching, methods, and the <em>doing</em> of methods. Being early-career researchers ourselves, reflexive conversations with peers will enable sharing of ways to tackle these challenges, which are often commonly faced. Through the discussions in the session, we hope to facilitate conversations which steer away from the conventional understandings of <em>doing</em> methods.</p>	    
	    <p>The participants will come from academic and non-academic backgrounds, who have looked at IMIs in Indian contexts. This session will explore the following two sub-themes:</p>
	    <ol><li>Access to participants: Doing a study of IMIs poses challenges such as identifying interactions as IMI; or gaining entry into specific Internet-mediated spaces (which may or may not be openly accessible).</li>
	    <li><em>Doing</em> methods: Fieldwork raises questions of what constitutes <em>doing</em> methods. While conversations about methods often end prior to physically conducting fieldwork, <em>doing</em> methods can cause tension with text-book constructs of methods.</li></ol>
	    <h4>Session Plan</h4>
	    <p>The introduction to the session will be followed by five talks of ten minutes each (of selected abstracts). The participants can present their experience of <em>doing</em> methods of works-in-progress, completed works, or composite reflections from past works.</p>
	    <p>On the confirmation of the session at IRC17, a call for abstracts will be shared, to invite people to send their ideas for the talks, from which five will be selected by the session organisers for presentation. These talks will be followed by a discussion for thirty minutes. For the session, we will need a room with a computer and projector, equipped for audio and video presentations; and pens and notebooks for the participants and organisers.</p>
	    <h4>Documentation Plan</h4>
	    <p>The talks and discussions of this session will be synthesised for the working paper (for IRC17). In the working paper, we hope to develop working definitions for key ideas identified during the session (an idea inspired from Boellstorff et al., 2012). This working paper will act as a starting point for future publications. Also, the dissemination of discussions to a wider non-academic audience will be informed by suggestions from the participants.</p>
