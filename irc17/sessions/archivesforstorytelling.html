	    <h4>Description of the Session</h4>
	    <p>In the oral history realm, where history is recorded based on oral accounts and typically via interviews, we can imagine that each storyteller has many different stories, each story has many different storytellers, each story has many different themes and vice-versa, and so on. Moreover, each personal history might be related to others based on common entities (eg. people and organizations), objects, time and space (eg. events, geography), and other conceptual objects that the accounts may comprise of. For example, is a given story referring to an event that someone else may also talk about in a seemingly unconnected way?</p>
	    <p>There is an incredible range of stories recorded in institutional archives and other stand-alone oral history projects. The point is not to re-store them in a new space on the web but to have a way to re-point to them in a new scheme. That is, make the connections explicit. The numerous stories among all of us, as separate individual accounts, might feel like they are irrelevant and unimportant beyond a few individuals or a closed group. By being able to see the interconnection between various individual accounts, can these stories become meaningful and relevant to a wider audience?</p>
	    <p>While WWW itself is a gigantic source of material, archives have existed for millennia at various institutions and with individuals. We discuss here the relevance of modelling archives for today by taking the knowledge bank of Indian Digital Heritage and NCBS@25 exhibit by presenting the work done towards storytelling using these archives.</p>
	    <p><strong>Concern:</strong> #ResearchToolsAndInfrastructure.</p>	   
	    <h4>Session Plan</h4>
	    <p>We have three representative individuals who present 1) a traditional folk story, 2) a transformation of this into an online visual story and 3) an elaboration on working on a demonstrative stories archive.</p>
	    <p>A traditional folk narrative that is a representation of the intangible cultural heritage of the Vijayanagara Empire is presented and some of these questions are brought forth regarding the related archival material that would help bring about development of visual versions of that story online. The role of social networking as part of this archival information is also discussed. The work on creating the stories of NCBS for its 25th year anniversary will be used to illustrate the archives work done to help in the rendition of stories relevant to such an anniversary.</p>	    
	    <h4>Documentation Plan</h4>
	    <p>We will be presenting ongoing work in this area and will be providing a post-conference write up as a summary of the the content presented including relevant audience discussions.</p>
