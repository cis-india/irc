	    <h3>10. #RenarrationWeb</h3>
	    <p><em>Last updated on Oct 31, 2016.</em></p>
	    <h5>&nbsp;</h5>
	    <h4>Description of the Session</h4>
	    <p>Renarration is as natural as speaking.</p>
	    <p>Over the last few centuries, reading and writing have mostly defined what the world considers as transferrable knowledge while oral traditions and storytelling have taken a back seat. With recording devices, via smart phones, becoming commonplace the wheel is likely to turn again towards storytelling as the primary manner in which history will be recorded in the future. This is easily imaginable when we realize that even today, where with aeons of effort towards educating the peoples of the world, a large majority can only be considered as low-literate. Even among the literate, only a small percentage can be considered to be enthusiastic readers/writers and more so when it comes to cross cultural and cross linguistic barriers. While a comeback of the oral tradition in an all new manner begs us visit how a narrator refers to others and constructs a narrative, a specific case would be when one renarrates it for a new audience. We need a way to model the realization of a web of conversations on the Internet.</p>
	    <p>Renarration is an investigation of content accessibility for Inclusion of all. While aiding a process of discovering and developing alternative narratives for diverse groups of people we also look at how narratives can semantically carry story information that can be used in identifying and helping developing target-specific narratives. Also to be presented: The current status of W3C Web Annotation model coming out as a recommendation and how such a standard can influence the future of a decentralized social semantic web, and there by the Renarration Web. An architecture of a Web that intrinsically supports renarrations and the role of story comparison tools, a number of use cases of renarration along with some attempts of building tools for these use cases.</p>
	    <p><strong>Concerns:</strong> #ResearchToolsAndInfrastructure, #BecomingDigital and #IndicLanguages</p>	    
	    <h4>Session Plan</h4>
	    <p>The idea of renarration will be situated using traditional and contemporary examples and the context will help us reflect on the state of the Web as we know it. Drawing from a recent literary work ‘In Search of Shiva’ by Mukunda Rao, the practices of renarration and its meaning in the lives and imaginations of people will be discussed, raising the question of web technology’s potential as an agent of renarration. Panelists will the introduce the current work of W3C Working Group on Web Annotation and the significance of this for the future Web and for ideas like that of renarration. One of the panelists will present tools for storytelling based on renarration. And another will present development of tools for story comparison. Significant time will be made available for audience participation.</p>
	    <p>Panel will conclude by presenting the current work on an architecture of Renarration Web.</p>
	    <h4>Documentation Plan</h4>
	    <p>We will have slides, show-and-tell videos and abstracts. Post-conference, we will either have a single academic paper together or separate ones from panelists.</p>
